# MonteCarlo

Monte Carlo methods and variance reduction

Monte Carlo methods (or Monte Carlo experiments) are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. Their essential idea is using randomness to solve problems or compute mathematical quantities that might be deterministic in principle. (wikipedia)
